## Scope 
- create a .net 6 console app that allows a user to register, login, and query the  http://restapi.adequateshop.com api, page through the users endpoint and save the user.id,user.name,user.email,and user.createdat properties to a local sqlite db file. Lastly, these saved records should be exported to a local csv file. 
- this doesnt need to be pretty, but needs to be idempotent and should handle most general error situations.
